For this purpose, a ROESY spectrum at 310 K with a 175 ms spin-lock allowed us to assign the amide–amide Overhauser enhancement between R6 and M5, which is unresolved from S7 at 279 K.","Nuclear Overhauser effect cross-peaks were assigned using&#10;FELIX.

NOE build-up curves of signal volume vs. mixing&#10;time were fitted to a quadratic polynomial. Approximate&#10;distance restraints were determined by comparing the&#10;volumes from cross-peaks of known distance (I8:  ̊&#10;|r(Hc11))r(Hc12)| 1⁄4 1.75 A) to cross-peaks of unknown distance using the isolated spin-pair approximation (49). Rather than using the simple classification of restraints into strong, medium, or weak, based on the NOE peak volumes, the higher precision of the distances derived from NOE build-ups enabled us to use the NOE-derived distances themselves as restraints. Upper and lower bounds of ±10% were introduced into these distances to accommodate spin-diffusion, conformational averaging and experimental uncertainties. Geminal methylene protons and vicinal methyl-groups, while often resolved in the peptide spectra, were handled conservatively by replacing them in the structures with pseudoatoms, placed between relevant atom positions, rather than by presumptively assigning prochirality.
